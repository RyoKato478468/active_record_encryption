# ActiverecordEncryption

Decorate encrypted binary column with attribute that transparently encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.
It uses the ActiveRecord's Attribute API, and it is a simpler implementation than other gems.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

# ```ruby
# gem 'activerecord_encryption'
# ```

## Usage

### Define serialized type in application

Here is an example of passing a type of object you want:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiverecordEncryption::EncryptedAttribute

  encrypted_attribute(:name, :string)
  encrypted_attribute(:published_on, :date)
end

---

$ post = Post.new(name: 'Author name', published_on: Date.current)
#=> #<Post:0x00007f92169ac158 id: nil, name: "Author name", published_on: Thu, 29 Mar 2018>
> post.save
DEBUG -- :    (0.1ms)  begin transaction
DEBUG -- :   Post Create (0.1ms)  INSERT INTO "posts" ("name", "published_on") VALUES (?, ?)  [["name", "N\xFA\xDD\xC2\xB0&\xAE\x9A..."], ["published_on", "N\xFA\xDD\xX2\xB0&\xAE\x9A..."]]
DEBUG -- :    (0.0ms)  commit transaction
```

### `#encrypted_attribute` options

You can pass the same arguments as [ActiveRecord::Attributes.attribute](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Attributes/ClassMethods/attribute)

```
class PointLog < ActiveRecord::Base
  encrypted_attribute(:date, :date)
  encrypted_attribute(:point, :integer, default: -> { Current.user.current_point })
  encrypted_attribute(:price, Money.new)
end
```

### Migration

Create or modify the table that your model uses to add a column like the following:

**NOTE: Default limit of binary is too long. Please set limit of encrypted columns**

```ruby
-ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
  create_table(:posts, force: true) do |t|
    t.binary :name, limit: 256
    t.binary :point, limit: 256
    t.binary :price, limit: 256
  end
end
```

*Tips* How to calculate limit of encrypted column? - It depends on algorithm of cipher.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Run spec

```
bundle exec appraisal install
bundle exec appraisal 5.0-stable rspec
bundle exec appraisal 5.1-stable rspec
bundle exec appraisal 5.2-stable rspec
```
